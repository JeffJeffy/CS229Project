# CS229Project
This is a course project for CS299 Fall 2019.

The objective is to predict movie ratings based on three types of data: image(posters), text(synopses), and others (genre, director, etc).

The original dataset came from: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset and https://www.kaggle.com/neha1703/movie-genre-from-its-poster.

Preprocessed Data: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EMIwSA-ISJ8C9LdvHJRh3VvcCW7Ll09D
